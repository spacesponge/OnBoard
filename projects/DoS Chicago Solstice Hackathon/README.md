# DoS Chicago Solstice Hackathon

<!-- Boards for the 2024 Chicago Day of Service Hackathon with a Summer Solstice and Egyptian theme. Board lights up when tapped and also has qr code back to our website. -->

<!-- It is $52.20 for all the boards needed for the even and we hope to get them by June 19th ( Hackathon starts on the 20th )-->

<!-- My first time making a PCB so it was a bit of learning curve. Luckily I had a really great tutorial to guide me! -->
